### Using Chest X-rays and Deep Learning  
*DATA 606 – Capstone in Data Science (Spring 2025)*  
**Team F**: Sugayathri Devi Ponnada, Ishita Reddy Annreddy, Deepika Bode

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project automates the detection of thoracic diseases from chest X-rays and generates human-readable radiology reports using deep learning.

We built a robust multi-label classifier and a lightweight NLP pipeline to support radiologists with faster, more consistent diagnoses.

## 📂 Dataset Summary

- **Dataset**: [CXR8-Selected (NIH ChestX-ray14 subset)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/myylee/cxr8-selected)  
- **Samples**: 112,120 frontal-view X-rays  
- **Diseases**: Focused on 7 classes: Effusion, Atelectasis, Pneumonia, Nodule, Mass, Cardiomegaly, Pneumothorax  
- **Preprocessing**: CLAHE contrast, grayscale normalization, multi-label binarization  
- **Source**: [Hosted on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Sugayathri/crx8selected)

## 🧠 Modeling Approach

- 🔄 **5-Fold Multi-label Stratified Cross-Validation**
- 🧱 Ensemble of **DenseNet121** + **EfficientNet-B3**
- ⚖️ Custom class thresholds for disease detection
- 📝 PDF report generation using ReportLab
- 🧪 Test-time ensemble prediction

## 💡 Challenges Faced

- Severe class imbalance in diseases like Pneumonia
- Weak supervision (label noise) in the NIH dataset
- Google Colab compute/memory limits during training
- Real-time inference latency & model optimization

---

## 🔮 What’s Next?

- 🔍 Add explainability features like Grad-CAM
- 🧠 Explore **ViT** or **Swin Transformers** for vision
- 🗣 Use **BioGPT/T5** for richer NLP report summaries
- 🏥 Collaborate with radiologists for clinical validation
